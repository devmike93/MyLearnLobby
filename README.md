## Story

Our project began as an ambitious idea to streamline e-learning into a centralized platform, ultimately giving birth to a powerful tool for educators and learners alike. We aimed to create a platform that not only organized educational content efficiently but also offered dynamic features to enhance user experience. Here's a glimpse into our journey and the technology stack that made it all possible.

To keep our tasks and communication organized, we utilized a Kanban board on Trello. This allowed us to track our progress, assign tasks, and ensure that everyone was on the same page throughout the development process.
